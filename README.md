# Virginia Child Care Facilities

What is this project?
------
Working with David Moore from Smart Beginnings NRV, we are working on developing a useful website for exploring data around child care facilities in Virginia. The current [Virginia Department of Social Services](https://www.dss.virginia.gov/facility/search/cc.cgi) (DSS) website includes limited ability to export and explore that data. This project is the front-end portion for providing a better interface to this data. See the [server-side](https://github.com/CodeforNRV/dss-virginia-server) repository as well.
* HTML and Javascript (Python portions being migrated to the server-side repository)

Status
------
Ongoing development with current deployment at http://codefornrv.github.io/dss-virginia
